        <h2 style="color: blue;"><b>ABOUT US</b></h2>
        <p>We are delivering the fresh meat since 1995 without being established online services,
            since we started serving you authentic Mansoor Country Chicken not even once have we increased 
            our prices in spite of input costs going up for our farmers and for our operations. To continue 
            to be operational sustainably, and to serve you the most authentic country chickens we are compelled 
            to pass on a proportionate increase in price.For example the
             whole chicken at 950 grams was priced at Rs 987 and will be now Rs 1091. 
             This slight change in price will be effective 1st March and we hope you support in our 
             endeavour to help farmers and provide clean, ethical and environmentally sustainable meat 
             products to your doorstep.
            With the Mansoor Meat Online,
            fresh meat is guaranteed! Your meat is harvested after you order. We request you to order at
             least 1 day in advance for quality meat</p>
